    "bio": "Hi...Aritra here. I've just completed my M.Sc. Chemistry degree from Pondicherry Central University, India. I'm mainly interested in Chemical Information Science (mainly known as Computational Chemistry) & Bonding Analysis. I love studying reasearch articles and implementing those concepts in my work. Also, I love teaching, whether it is junior or fellow-student. It is lovely to engage people around me in chemistry by relating as much as possible to everyday life through questioning and experiential way. Also, I'm seeking to learn new part of theoretical studies like Molecular Docking, Virtual Screening, MD Simulation etc.",

He does the chemistry very well in both the field, theoretical and practical. He has a keen focused mindset to be a theoretician. On the other hand he has a very strong knowledge in computational algorithms. I will sincerely recommend him to in the field of theoretical chemical research.",
